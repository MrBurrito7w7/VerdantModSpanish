- Synced all boss downed flags for the Apotheosis
- Fixed the Eye downed flag not syncing properly
- Fixed most Aquariums and Terrariums not having their anchors set properly
- Fixed Verdant Staff lack of syncing

	Instead, now players can each have one of their own Flower, with a 25% heal speed reduction per flower for balance
